## Projects
* ### Hello:
  This prints text - "Hello xlwings!" into A1 cell in sheet 1 of the workbook.
  
  **Steps:**
  - `$ xlwings quickstart abhi` in any preferable directory. It gives:

    ```bash
    .
    ├── abhi.py
    ├── abhi.xlsm
    ```
  - goto `"Developer"` tab in excel.
  - goto "Module1" and run.
  - It shows the output.
* ### Button
  This can be used in order to run a script when needed. Basically, on a sheet in a workbook where we don't want to run the script all the time. Like <kbd>Fetch QC status</kbd> button used to display the QC status on a MessageBox.
  
  **Follow the steps:**
  - Go to the "Developer" tab in Excel.
  - Create a button "Insert >> Button" on an excel sheet.
  - Assign a macro by right clicking on the button.
  - Copy and Paste the snippet from the default "module 1" to "button1_click" module. 
  ```vba
  mymodule = Left(ThisWorkbook.name, (InStrRev(ThisWorkbook.name, ".", -1, vbTextCompare) - 1))
  RunPython ("import " & mymodule & ";" & mymodule & ".main()")
  ```
  - From now, click on the button and the .py code will run and show the desired output.
  
## Shortcut keys
* <kbd>ctrl + backspace</kbd> - bring the cursor near the word, you get to see the dialog with its features. <br/>
  NOTE: Anaconda package in ST3 has to be installed first.
* <kbd>shift + F3</kbd> - shows the "Function Wizard" dialog.
